# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, chidimo here

I'm a frontend developer with Softcom, currently working on [Koya](https://koya.co) LMS.

I'm currently sharpening my GraphQL skills with a side project, employing `Apollo Client` on the frontend and `Graphene-Python` (`Graphene-Django`) on the backend.

I'm also taking baby steps in TypeScript.
